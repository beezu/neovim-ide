# neovim-ide
This project was heavily inspired by [Neovim From Scratch](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch) and much of the code here is either from that project or at least based upon it.

I include a Dockerfile for my build, and images are published in X64 and ARM64 on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/beezu/neovim)

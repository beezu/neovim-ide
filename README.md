# Neovim-IDE

My config was originally based on [Neovim From Scratch](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch). During a major refactor, [The Primeagen's neovimrc repo](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/neovimrc) served as inspiration for the config structure, and some of his configuration was used in mine as well.

Languages/filetypes that this config's LSP supports out of the box:
- Dockerfile
- gdscript (supported but needs to be installed from Mason)
- Lua (and Love2D)
- PowerShell
- Python
- Rust
- Swift (note: requires XCode to be installed)
- yaml
